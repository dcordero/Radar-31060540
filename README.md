AVPlayerViewController, weird progress behaviour when zapping among live streams

Â· Open radar: https://openradar.appspot.com/31060540

# Update

This issue was resolved in tvOS 11 beta 2 (15J5310e)

# Description
When changing among different live stream assets the progress bar and the indicator presented by AVPlayerViewController jump and flash from the beginning to the end of the event window.

# Steps

This project zaps among 2 different live streams when pressing left or right.

# Expected
The progress indicator points directly to the live position without any jump or flash on the view

tvOS 10.2
